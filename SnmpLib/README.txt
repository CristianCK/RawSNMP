The greater purpose of this project is to create 
an api with the methods of the SNMP protocol, 
purely building and sending packets via UDP. 
The first implementation is a hard-codded trap v1.
Lets create a fully functional api with all SNMP1 verbs.
Next steps: 
	- all v1 verbs: get, getnext, getbulk, set, etc.
	- snmp v2 inform.
	- all v2 verbs...
	- authentication
	- all v3 verbs...
